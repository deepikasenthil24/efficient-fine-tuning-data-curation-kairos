# efficient-fine-tuning-data-curation-kairos
Data Science Capstone Profile for DSC 180B at UCSD

This project uses KAIROS to curate a smaller, higher quality dataset from a large messy dataset that we then use to fine-tune a ResNet-50 model for our task of classifying insect images. We analyze the results and evaluate the performance of our methods with metrics including F1 and runtime on both KAIROS curation performance and ResNet-50 classification performance.
